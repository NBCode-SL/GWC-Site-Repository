                        <td>The French Honor Society, also known as La Société d'Honneur de Français (SHF), is an 
                            academic organization dedicated to promoting the study of the French language and 
                            Francophone cultures within the school and local community. Throughout the academic year, 
                            members meet 1-2 times per month to engage in culturally enriching activities that deepen 
                            their understanding of the Francophone world. SHF members are expected to actively 
                            participate in service projects, such as organizing cultural presentations, tutoring 
                            fellow students in French, and coordinating bake sales to raise funds for society events.

                            SHF works closely with the French Club to host a variety of cultural events throughout 
                            the year, such as the Autumn Festival, Three Kings Day, Mardi Gras, and Crêpe Day. These 
                            events celebrate the rich diversity within the Francophone community through food, 
                            activities, and performances. While SHF and the French Club have their own board members, 
                            they frequently collaborate to create these engaging experiences for the school.
